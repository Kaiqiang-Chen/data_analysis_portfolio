# Aleksandr Nikitin - Data Analysis Portfolio 

## About

Hi, I'm Alex! I have a technical background and hold a Master of Science (M.S.) degree in geoscience (Saint Petersburg Mining University), majoring in Seismic Data Processing and Analysis. I had worked for 12 years in geoscience playing roles as Data Processing Engineer, Head of Department and CTO in a technological startup. Now I'm in transition to Data Analytics and Data Science because the world of data is not limited only to geoscience and I find myself being constantly fascinated by insights Data can reveal.  
<br>
This is a repository that I have created to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Analytics / Data Science related topics.  
<br>
Looking for a Data Analyst job, open for starting positions or internship.

## Portfolio Projects
In this section I will list data analytics projects briefly describing the technology stack used to solve cases.

### Video Games Sales Analysis
**Filename:** [`video_games_sales.ipynb`](https://github.com/nktnlx/data_analysis_portfolio/blob/main/video_games_sales.ipynb)    
**Description:** The dataset contains 16715 records as of 2016. There is a list of video games with sales (by region), year of release, platform, critics and users score. The project includes the following steps: data loading, data cleaning and preprocessing, filling missing values, EDA (exploratory data analysis), analyzing region based user profiles, measuring statistical factors, hypothesis testing.  
**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, descriptive statistics, central limit theorem, hypothesis testing, data visualization.  
**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Scipy Stats, Seaborn, Matplotlib.  
**Results:** Review of the global and regional video games markets, data-based business recommendations.  

## Study Projects
In this section I will provide links to my github repositories containing code and jupyter notebooks I created while passing online courses or was just having fun with.
